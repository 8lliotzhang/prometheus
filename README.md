*It's a bad pun, I know.*

I'm learning how LSTMs work a bit more in detail, by employing that ancient and secret coding technique known as "stealing code that works". For me, this "project" is more of a hands-on learning experience where I take a working LSTM, break each component down, figure how each part works, and then write a lot of comments about that. (no need to put it back together, because, well, it's not physical. The analogy kinda breaks down here, unlike the code.)

The goal is to have some completed project as a downloadable app.

In the meantime, checkout the [blag](https://8lliotzhang.github.io/prometheus/) I'm writing! (it's a failsafe to track progess in case I run out of time)
